### What are libraries for
Libraries are here to facilitate the developer.

Inside it, you would be able to find useful functions so you wouldn't have to reinvent the wheel and use functions that are doing their job.

In the project, you will have to code functions that are asked in the subject.

### Overview
In the mandatory part, you have to implement 34 functions where you will learn about conditions, loops, arrays, pointers, and memory management.

In the bonus part, you will learn about linked lists.


### Quick Start
You have to install cmake, a C compiler.

Then you can `make` the project and have your libft.a. You will be able to use it in future projects if you want, adding more and more function inside it.


### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/libft.git
    cd libft
    ```

2. Build the library:
    ```sh
    make
    ```


### Usage
To use the library in your project, include the header file and link the compiled library:
```c
#include "libft.h"
```
