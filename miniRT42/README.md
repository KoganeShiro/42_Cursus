## The project
miniRT42 is a mini raytracer developed in C, using the minilibX library.
It is a group project and i pared with [echapuis](https://github.com/Asa973) who did most of the math behind ðŸ¤£

TL;DR:
The principle is to simulate the behavior of light by casting virtual rays to determine the color of each pixel in the rendered image.

## Features

The raytracer can represent three types of objects:

-  Sphere: Defined by its color, position, and radius.  
-  Infinite Plane: Defined by its color, position, and normal vector.
-  Hollow Cylinder: Defined by its color, position, radius, and height.

## Scene Description

The 3D scene description is stored in a .rt file, which is parsed to obtain the necessary information for each object, such as its color, position, and dimensions.

## Installation

  Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/KoganeShiro/42_Cursus.git
cd 42_Cursus/miniRT42
```

Compile the project:

```
make
```

## Usage

To run the raytracer, use the following command:
```
./miniRT42 [scene_file.rt]
```

## Ressources
We didn't use all of these but the main points if you want to do it would be
- Have some basic knowledge of vector and high school math
- Know what is a viewport or viewplane (vs canva) and how to calculate it
- Each ray will give you a specific color on the canva
- To know the color, we have to calculate if we ever hit something
- We have mathematical equation to know this, you can check this website: https://hugi.scene.org/online/hugi24/coding%20graphics%20chris%20dragan%20raytracing%20shapes.htm you only have to implement this
- If there is an intersection (a hit) between the ray and the object, you have to determine which one is the closest to the viewport (the result of the equation (root(s)) will give you the distance between the object hit and the origine of the ray
- Compare the distance of all the object in the scene to know which color to show
- Know that you know the basic color, you have to calculate the light of the color
- For that you have to add the light intensity (L) + the ambient light (A) + the color of the nearest object
- Of course if no object is hit, you only hav to return the background color
- You now have the final color of the pixel !
- Loop on all the pixels to have the final image

Tips:
 - Start by having the outline of the sphere without the light, when you have it, you can add the light and continue with the plane and the cylinder.
 - Know that the plane is infinite
 - The cylinder may be infinite, that's why you need to clamp the height of the cylinder
 - Also the cylinder will be a hollow cylinder. If you want, you can cap the cylinder with planes.
