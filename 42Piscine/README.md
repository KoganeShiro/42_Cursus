# 42_Piscine

The concept of a "piscine" in the context of 42 comes from the French word for "swimming pool," and it is used metaphorically to describe an immersive and challenging coding experience.

In the 42 coding school, a piscine is a period of intense learning of 26 days of coding where participants work on various programming projects and challenges. It's designed to be a rigorous and immersive experience, allowing individuals to develop their coding skills in a short amount of time

Here are the programs that i did during my piscine at Le Havre (France)
