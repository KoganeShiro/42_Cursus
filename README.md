## The School
42 is a private, nonprofit and tuition-free computer programming school that was founded in France by Xavier Niel.
The school is known for its unique and innovative approach to education, with a focus on project-based learning and peer-to-peer collaboration.

We operate within a system known as the blackhole, functioning as our ultimate deadline. To elaborate, when there's just one week left in the blackhole, failing to submit a project means it engulfs us, marking the end of our status as 42 students.

To clarify the incentive, successful project submissions not only contribute to our experience but also grant additional days to push back the final deadline imposed by the blackhole.

You can see how many days a project can give you on [42evaluators](https://42evaluators.com/calculator) a project made by 42 students for them. You can also see your rank in your school or even a map of student close to the blackhole to help them.


Here is how we can see our projects (called the Holy Graph):

We have a maximum of two years to navigate the common core, typically concluding in an average of one year.


Following the common core, students can choose from eight specialized branches. The common core is what are inside all the circles and all the branches outside of the circles are the specializations.
